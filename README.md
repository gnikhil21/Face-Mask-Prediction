# Face-Mask-Prediction
This is a face mask prediction system which predicts if a person is wearing a mask or not.
It is done in python and neural networks are being used for training and testing the data.

Around 6000 facial imgaes are used as data of which 90% is used for training and the remaing 10% for testing.
Few of the images used in data :-

Neural networks concepts such as forward and backward propagation are implemented from scratch.
To improve the performance of the system optimization techniques such as regularization, adam optimization and batch gradient descent are used.
95% test accuracy is obtained.
